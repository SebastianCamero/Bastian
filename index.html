   I made this short message to let you know that i like you so muchhh I'm not that good at expressing my feelings but i put effort into this message, because i want you to know that I'm serious about my feelings. As i've watched myself falling for you, I'm also afraid that you can't reciprocate it. But I'd only admire you from afar. I want to tell you na your still my crush, hoping for crush back. Im always here to support you secretly. Our feelings may not be the same but it's the truth. I just want you to know that I will be always your fan, cheering on you secretly. I am always here, silently wishing all the best for you. Until the last star in the galaxy dies, you will always have me. No one can replace you. I have no idea why, I just can't. You know what, im so happy when I meet you and im always  here to support you thank you because you make me smile.keep safe always!!
